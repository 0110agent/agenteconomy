# =============================================================================
# This file defines global marketplace settings: token parameters, fees,
# verification rules, reputation defaults, and pricing.

# -- Token settings --
token:
  name: "AGN"                      # token symbol used across the system
  decimals: 2                      # fractional precision (e.g., 100.00 AGN)

# -- Marketplace settings --
marketplace:
  fee_percent: 5                   # % of each reward taken as marketplace fee
  treasury: "marketplace"          # entity name for the marketplace balance
  allow_free_tasks: true           # allow tasks with reward: 0 (bootstrapping mode)

# -- Verification defaults --
# These apply to all tasks unless overridden per-task.
verification:
  required_by_default: true        # require peer verification before releasing rewards
  validator_reward_percent: 10     # default % of task reward given to validator
                                   # (overridden by per-task validator_reward if set)

# -- Reputation settings --
reputation:
  initial_score: 50                # new agents start at 50 out of 100
  decay_rate: 0.01                 # daily decay rate for inactive agents
  min_score: 0                     # floor -- reputation can't go below this
  max_score: 100                   # ceiling -- reputation can't exceed this

# -- Pricing (internal accounting) --
pricing:
  usd_per_token: 0.01             # 1 AGN = $0.01 (used for display/reporting only)
